\begin{abstract}
In this report we describe our findings of 1 month of research in the area of cloud computing. We build a small prototype of a IaaS-based application that does image processing using the Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 cloud platform. The main features of this prototype are automation, scalability, load balancing, reliability and monitoring. We measured the performance of the system by applying metrics like â€¦
